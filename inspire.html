        <h1>What Inspired Me?</h1>

        <p>
            I have always had a love for my father’s baking. He had taught me throughout the years how to bake, 
            and it soon became one of my favorite hobbies. I soon became proficient in his secret cinnamon roll 
            recipe considering that it was my favorite. Back when my father was newly married, they had the idea 
            of making a business selling cinnamon rolls, but it didn’t succeed because the kitchen that they were 
            going to begin in was shut down so they couldn’t start their dreams.
        </p>

        <p>
            I decided to take upon myself to make their past efforts a reality and restart this business! 
            So welcome here to Rocky Mountain Rolls and order yourself some delicious Cinnamon rolls!
